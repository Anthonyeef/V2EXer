This file displays people on V2EX I think is worth following.
I try to arrange people by the area they are working on. It could be wrong when you try to add some tag to a person, luckly no one would care XD.

Don't waste your time on Internet. Nowadays it's easy to surf the Internet, while valuable information and brilliant people are not easy to find. An easy way is to follow them and only recieve information from them.

Wish it could help.
